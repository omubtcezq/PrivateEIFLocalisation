  abstract = {Suppose that a set of multiple users uploads in every time period encrypted values of some data. The considered problem is how an untrusted data aggregator can compute the sum of all users' values but nothing more. A solution was recently given by Shi et al. (NDSS 2011). However, as advocated by the authors, the proposed encryption scheme suffers from some limitations. In particular, its usage is restricted to small plaintext spaces. This paper presents a practical scheme which, advantageously, can accommodate large plaintext spaces. Somewhat surprisingly, it comes with an efficient security reduction, regardless of the number of users. Furthermore, the proposed scheme requires a minimal number of interactions, is efficient for both encryption and decryption/aggregation and can operate in an off-line/on-line mode.},

  abstract = {Cooperative control for multi-agent systems usually requires some communication between the various subsystems. In the resulting networked control system, sensitive data is transmitted and shared between the agents. We propose a novel encrypted control scheme that ensures privacy of the individual agents' data not only during transmission but also during controller evaluations at neighboring agents. Our control scheme efficiently combines the design of structured feedback laws for multi-agent systems with encrypted controllers for conventional linear systems. The underlying key technology is partial homomorphic encryption, which allows simple computations to be carried out on encrypted data.},

  abstract = {We consider how an untrusted data aggregator can learn desired statistics over multiple participants' data, without compromising each individual's privacy. We propose a construction that allows a group of participants to periodically upload encrypted values to a data aggregator, such that the aggregator is able to compute the sum of all participants' values in every time period, but is unable to learn anything else. We achieve strong privacy guarantees using two main techniques. First, we show how to utilize applied cryptographic techniques to allow the aggregator to decrypt the sum from multiple ciphertexts encrypted under different user keys. Second, we describe a distributed data randomization procedure that guarantees the differential privacy of the outcome statistic, even when a subset of participants might be compromised.},
