This paper concerns the localization problem under privacy constraints.
Cryptographic schemes have been devised by the authors to achieve some
privacy requirements. The contribution is significant enough and the
paper is well written but hard to understand for a usual reader of IEEE
TAC due to sections with cryptographic background. 
As a TAC paper, performance analysis in terms of estimation accuracy
was expected but is actually missing. This reviewer wonders if IEEE TAC
is well adapted for an efficient exposition of the authors’ findings. 
In the framework of a Control theory paper, cryptographic notions would
be kept as minimum as possible in the main body of the paper or moved
to Appendices.
