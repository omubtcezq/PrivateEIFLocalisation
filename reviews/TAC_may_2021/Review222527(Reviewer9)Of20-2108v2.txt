This paper deals with a suitable notion of linear-combination
aggregation encryption and provides a cryptographically secure instance
applied to a filter with range-sensor measurements. This approach keeps
navigator location, sensor’s location and sensors’ measurements private
during navigation.

The proposed approach is interesting and the results are technically
sound. The literature review is OK. But the organization of paper and
its length make its reading difficult.
The reviewer encourages the authors to reorganize the article by
greatly shortening it and to highlight the novelty. Some additional
comments are given below:
 -Introduction (2 pages) is too long and does not focus on the main
ideas of the paper. There are too many reminders of classical notions. 

-Equation (3): i from 1 to n must be added.
-The actual computation steps are in fact scattered all over the paper,
in several sections.  In the current version, the reader has to collect
all the scattered pieces to come out with the approach. I would
therefore, strongly recommend the authors to summarize all the steps of
the approach gathered by the end of the paper, to
help the reader directly use and implement the algorithm.
-Page 10, Equation (36), Right part of Equation: d is from 0 to D
-Inequality (50) must be clarified,
-Algorithm 1, steps 2/3/4, it is F_{k-1},
-Section VIII-some explanations on the process model must be added.
Figure 6 is too small; it is difficult to distinguish the different
lines.
