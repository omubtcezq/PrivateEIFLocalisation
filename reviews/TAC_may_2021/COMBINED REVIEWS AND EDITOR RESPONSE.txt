COMBINED REVIEWS AND EDITOR RESPONSE

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EDITOR
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Dr. Ristic:

Your paper “Privacy-Preserving Localization Using Private Linear-Combination Aggregation”, Number 20-2108, that you submitted for possible publication in the IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control has now been reviewed.  Copies of the reviews are enclosed.

Based on the reviews, it is our decision that the paper cannot be accepted for publication in the Transactions in its present form.
 
The reviewers feel the paper interesting, which many include publishable materials. On the other hand, the reviewers feel the paper should be reorganized by shortening the length (e.g. introduction etc.), and highlight the novelty and contribution. Also the relevance of the paper to the journal should be clarified. 
 
We encourage you to examine carefully the comments of the enclosed reviews and to consider making a major revision of the paper, which can be resubmitted as a Technical Note, to the Transactions on Automatic Control.  If you do submit a revised version of the paper as a Technical Note, you should take care that the paper is reduced to no
more than 8 double-column pages using IEEE template.   

In your letter of transmittal, you should include a detailed "author's response" document describing the changes in the paper and you should refer to the present paper number.

Please login, click on the "Author" link at the bottom of your access page, and upload your technical note under the SAME reference number. A new reference number will be assigned to your revised paper.


Sincerely,

Dr. Zhiwei Gao

REVIEWER 1

This paper concerns the localization problem under privacy constraints.
Cryptographic schemes have been devised by the authors to achieve some
privacy requirements. The contribution is significant enough and the
paper is well written but hard to understand for a usual reader of IEEE
TAC due to sections with cryptographic background. 
As a TAC paper, performance analysis in terms of estimation accuracy
was expected but is actually missing. This reviewer wonders if IEEE TAC
is well adapted for an efficient exposition of the authors� findings. 
In the framework of a Control theory paper, cryptographic notions would
be kept as minimum as possible in the main body of the paper or moved
to Appendices.

REVIEWER 2

This paper deals with a suitable notion of linear-combination
aggregation encryption and provides a cryptographically secure instance
applied to a filter with range-sensor measurements. This approach keeps
navigator location, sensor�s location and sensors� measurements private
during navigation.

The proposed approach is interesting and the results are technically
sound. The literature review is OK. But the organization of paper and
its length make its reading difficult.
The reviewer encourages the authors to reorganize the article by
greatly shortening it and to highlight the novelty. Some additional
comments are given below:
 -Introduction (2 pages) is too long and does not focus on the main
ideas of the paper. There are too many reminders of classical notions. 

-Equation (3): i from 1 to n must be added.
-The actual computation steps are in fact scattered all over the paper,
in several sections.  In the current version, the reader has to collect
all the scattered pieces to come out with the approach. I would
therefore, strongly recommend the authors to summarize all the steps of
the approach gathered by the end of the paper, to
help the reader directly use and implement the algorithm.
-Page 10, Equation (36), Right part of Equation: d is from 0 to D
-Inequality (50) must be clarified,
-Algorithm 1, steps 2/3/4, it is F_{k-1},
-Section VIII-some explanations on the process model must be added.
Figure 6 is too small; it is difficult to distinguish the different
lines.

REVIEWER 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This paper presented a theoretical framework for privacy-preserving
localisation combining the encryption scheme and filtering. In
particular, the private linear-combination aggregation has been adopted
in the presented framework. Basically, the contribution of the paper is
clearly indicated with an interesting and important topic. However,
some technical problems need to be further clarified. Therefore, a
major revision is necessary in my opinion.

1) Is any filtering method can be integrated into the presented
framework? If so, can we replace the method via numerical approach such
as particle filter.
2) How does the linear combination reflect the dynamics of the
investigated system in Eq.(2)?
3) Why is the noise of the system Gaussian? In Eq.(2), function f() is
known then what is the physical meaning of the Gaussian process noise?
4) In the paper, the noise is depended on covariance matrix $Q$ which
is also particularly used in Algroithm 1, however, in practice, Q is
unmeasurable and unknown. How to estimate the value of Q in terms of
performance guarantee. 
5) The experimental results are limited. The comparison is essential to
validate the performance of the presented algorithm. What about using
the existing filtering method to demonstrate the various encryption
scheme?
6) There are some typos in the manuscript please correct them, for
example, page 1 Notation, '$\left\|\underline a\right\|$ the vector
norm' should be '$\left\|\underline a\right\|$ is the vector norm' etc.
