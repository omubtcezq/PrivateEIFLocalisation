The authors have significantly improved the readability of the paper.
The contribution is significant enough for privacy preserving state
estimation. However, this reviewer still have few comments:
1- It could be interesting to comment why sensor variance is a private
information. Why is it crucial to preserve it if measurements are
already protected?

2- In the sentence 'homomorphic encryption is used to make
time-independent model-free location estimates where an estimator does
not learn sensor measurements or locations.; Shouldn't be 'cannot
learn'?

3- In problem statement 'we consider the context of privacy-preserving
range sensor navigation, where we want no sensor to learn information
about the navigator or other sensors beyond their local measurements,
and the navigator to learn no information about individual sensors
beyond its location estimate.', please specify type of information.

4- Indistinguishable weights: what would happen if the sensor learns
navigator weights?

5- Fix the following sentence: 'If an attacker compromises the
navigator, they have control over the weights,'

6- Define IND-CPA.

7- Simulation: The authors have found that 1.7 s are needed for each
computation step, is that compatible with real-time operation?

8- Can you comment why quantization noise, involved in the
encryption-decryption schemes, isn't taken into account in the filter
equations?
