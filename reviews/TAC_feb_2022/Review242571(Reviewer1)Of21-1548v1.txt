Thank you for updating the manuscript and most of the concerns have
been addressed well in the response letter. However, there is one
problem still confused me. The authors claimed that the Gaussian
assumption has been removed in the revised version, however, the EKF
(EIF) was still used for prediction (Eqs. 26-27). Basically, the EKF is
based on the Gaussian assumption and the prediction is obtained in the
sense of mean value. Then, the non-Gaussian dynamics would affect the
prediction performance using EKF if the Gaussian assumption is removed.
My point is 1) if the assumption is removed, please explain the
non-Gaussian influence from the EKF or 2) if the Gaussian assumption
remains in the manuscript, please explain from the noise comes from in
physics sense.
