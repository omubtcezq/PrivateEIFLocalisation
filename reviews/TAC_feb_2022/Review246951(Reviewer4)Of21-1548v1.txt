Comments:
This paper proposes a novel distributed localisation method in the
presence of range-only sensors, which preserves both navigator and
sensor privacies. The major contribution of this paper is that a novel
private linear combination aggregation scheme is proposed, and based on
that, a modified extended Kalman filter is also derived. Some comments
are given as follows:

1.In this paper, the full names of some abbreviations are not given.
For example, in Section I, page 1, left column, “AES”and “RSA”, and in
Section I, page 1, right column, “pWSAc” and “pWSAh”.

2.The authors should elaborate the advantages and disadvantages of the
existing typical cryptographic secrecy scheme and the motivation for
proposing private linear combination aggregation scheme in this paper.

3.Some symbols are reused. For example, In Section I, Notation,
“timestep k” and “will denote encryption and decryption with key k”.

4.The authors need to present theoretical computational complexity of
the proposed method.

5.The authors should state how to measure the performance of the
private linear combination aggregation scheme proposed in this paper.

6.In practical engineering application, how to balance the relationship
between key sizes and computation.
